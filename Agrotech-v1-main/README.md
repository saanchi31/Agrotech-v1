🌱 AgroTech — Smart Farming Dashboard

> 🚀 A Smart Agriculture System combining IoT + Web App + Android APK to improve crop monitoring, disease detection, and farm decision-making.

---

📌 Overview

AgroTech is a full-stack smart farming solution that integrates:

* 🌐 Web Application
* 📱 Android Application (APK via Android Studio)
* 📡 IoT Sensors (ESP32 + Soil, Temp, Humidity)
* 📷 ESP32-CAM (Live Field Monitoring)

This system enables farmers to **monitor crops in real-time, detect issues early, and make data-driven decisions.

⚙️ Architecture

* Uses WebView technology
* Loads the AgroTech web app inside mobile app
* Fully supports:

  * Firebase authentication
  * Real-time sensor data
  * ESP32-CAM image capture

---

 🛠️ Android Studio Setup

 Requirements

* Android Studio
* Android SDK
* Java (JDK)

---

 Implementation Steps

1. Create new project (Empty Activity)
2. Add WebView in `MainActivity.java`
3. Enable JavaScript
4. Load web app URL
5. Add internet permission

---

 💻 WebView Code

```java id="code1"
WebView webView = new WebView(this);
setContentView(webView);

webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());

webView.loadUrl("https://your-website-link.com");
```

---

🔐 Required Permission

```xml id="code2"
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

---

 📦 APK Generation

* Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK
* Output:

```
app-release.apk
```

🛠️ Technologies Used

| Category   | Technology Used               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend   | HTML, CSS, JavaScript         |
| Backend    | Firebase (Auth + Realtime DB) |
| IoT        | ESP32 + Sensors               |
| Camera     | ESP32-CAM                     |
| Charts     | Chart.js                      |
| Mobile App | Android Studio (WebView)      |

---

 ⚙️ System Workflow

```
ESP32 Sensors → Firebase → Web App → Android App
```

1. Sensors collect real-time data
2. ESP32 sends data to Firebase
3. Web app fetches & displays data
4. Android app loads same system
5. User receives insights & recommendations

---

 📡 IoT Integration

* Soil Moisture
* Temperature
* Humidity

Data path:

```
/agrotech/sensors
```

---

⚠️ Important Notes

* ⚠️ This is a prototype system
* 🤖 AI detection is currently simulated
* 📶 ESP32 must be on same WiFi network
* 📱 APK uses WebView architecture

---
🔮 Future Scope

* Real AI model integration (TensorFlow)
* Native Android UI
* Offline mode for rural areas
* Automated irrigation system
* Cloud-based analytics
